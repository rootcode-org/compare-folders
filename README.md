# Compare-Folders
Fast comparison of large folders

```
compare-folders.py [-t] [-c] <path> <path>

where,
   -t       compare file timestamps
   -c       compare file contents (overrides -t)
   <path>   path to file system folder
   
If neither option is specified then files are compared by file name and size only.
```
